        <h2>Intro:</h2>
        
        <p>This website was built with the intention to help those who were interested in vinyl records and turntables. This site holds most of the information one needs to hit the ground running when trying to break into the scene of vinyl music and the accessories that are needed for quality assurance in regards to the records and players. By going through the links provide show detailed descriptions about albums and knowing what to look for, information about turn tables, popular places to find records and a page about general information in taking care of your albums.</p>

        <h3>About:</h3>
        
        <p>The idea I would like to have for this site is for users to explore the world of vinyl records. Although this type of format seems outdated, it has been seeing a recent surge in popularity. Since this is becoming a more popular trend, there may be new people wanting to break ground in this new-found hobby but don’t know where to start. There are a lot of things to look for when selecting albums and turn tables which some people can overlook. The purpose of my site will help inform the user of these things and help them select a high-quality album for the right price in a sea of doubt.</p>

        <p>For the target audience, I would like people of all walks of life with an interest in old types of media as well as a love for music. Anyone who has a new interest in or just looking for general information about albums would come to this site. I would like for people to be able to find new places to shop who are looking to find new albums (mostly for PA), have general information about taking care of turn tables and albums like do’s and don’ts and also have a pricing guide to know if an album is worth as much as the price as it’s marked.</p>
